# Personal NixOS Config

Fairly minimal i3 session focused on tmux utilites and functional shortcuts. Per device settings get loaded from the hosts directory depending on the hostname set in configuration.nix.

### Setup
Clone into `~/tmux-conf` and
Remember to symlink `configuration.nix` to `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`
